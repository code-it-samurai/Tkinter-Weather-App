# Tkinter-Weather-App
this is a completed tkinter project
An app that uses api services to get weather

I have removed my personal api key from the source code

Its a simple app that takes the name of a city from user
then gets infromation of current weather conditions of the entered city from an api 
then that information is processed
then it is shown with a background image related to that weather information
example:if the forcast says rain, the background image will be an image that portrays that forcast(rain)



Thank you for checking this out
